Portfolio Website built using Next.js + React.js

This is a static version of my Portfolio Website: [https://bashy.dev](https://bashy.dev)
The live website is an extended version of this project and it uses Strapi (a Headless CMS) for the back-end.
You can fork the repo and extend the project as you wish to suit your back-end preferences.

You'll find all relevant Demo Data in 'constants/defaultValues.js'.
For styling, I used Emotion: [https://emotion.sh](https://emotion.sh).
I made a simple theming kit to make it easier for you to customize the Interface.
You can edit the theme variable in 'constants/theme.js'.
Media Query breakpoints are defined in 'constants/mq.js'.
